The OXFORD toolbox is a set of demos used in motivating and describing the GP-LVM first used at a journal club in Oxford on January 27th 2006.

Version 0.131
-------------

Update demGplvmTalk with a further stick man example for regressive dynamics. First used for MIT and Google talks.

Version 0.13
------------

Release made for talk at Manchester Computer Science (22nd June 2006).

Version 0.12
------------

Release made for talk at Cambridge University Engineering.

Version 0.1
-----------

Initial release, set of demos to be used at Journal Club in Oxford on 27th January 2006. The prepDemManifold.m script requires the imrotate.m function from the image processing toolbox.

MATLAB Files
------------
