The OXFORD toolbox is a set of demos used in motivating and describing the GP-LVM first used at a journal club in Oxford on January 27th 2006.

Version 0.131
-------------

Update demGplvmTalk with a further stick man example for regressive dynamics. First used for MIT and Google talks.

Version 0.13
------------

Release made for talk at Manchester Computer Science (22nd June 2006).

Version 0.12
------------

Release made for talk at Cambridge University Engineering.

Version 0.1
-----------

Initial release, set of demos to be used at Journal Club in Oxford on 27th January 2006. The prepDemManifold.m script requires the imrotate.m function from the image processing toolbox.

MATLAB Files
------------

Matlab files associated with the toolbox are:

demBackMapping.m: Show difference in latent variable models that use a forward and reverse mapping.
demCovFuncSample.m: Sample from some different covariance functions.
demDigitsManifold.m: Project and rotate an artificial data set of handwritten digits. 
demDynamicsArrowPlot.m: Prepare an plot for arrow between two latent space plots.
demGPCov2D.m: Simple demonstration of sampling from a covariance function.
demGplvmTalk.m: Show demos for GP-LVM talk in order.
demGPSample.m: Simple demonstration of sampling from a covariance function.
demInterpolation.m: Demonstrate Gaussian processes for interpolation.
demKernelImages.m: Create plots of some covariance functions
demManifold.m: Show rotation of the digit 6/9.
demManifoldPrint.m: Print the principal components of the artificial digits data set.
demOptimiseKern.m: Shows that there is an optimum for the kernel length scale.
demRegression.m: Demonstrate Gaussian processes for regression.
demSix.m: Produce figures of the handwritten six and rotated versions.
demStickResults.m: Show the results of stick man optimisations interactively.
oxfordToolboxes.m: Toolboxes required for the Oxford demos.
prepDemManifold.m: Read in handwritten 6 and prepare for visualisation.
