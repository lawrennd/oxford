The OXFORD toolbox is a set of demos used in motivating and describing the GP-LVM first used at a journal club in Oxford on January 27th 2006.

Version 0.13
------------

Release made for talk at Manchester Computer Science (22nd June 2006).

Version 0.12
------------

Release made for talk at Cambridge University Engineering.

Version 0.1
-----------

Initial release, set of demos to be used at Journal Club in Oxford on 27th January 2006. The prepDemManifold.m script requires the imrotate.m function from the image processing toolbox.

MATLAB Files
------------

Matlab files associated with the toolbox are:

demStickResults.m: Show the results of stick man optimisations interactively.
demManifold.m: Show rotation of the digit 6/9.
demDigitsManifold.m: Project and rotate an artificial data set of handwritten digits. 
demCovFuncSample.m: Sample from some different covariance functions.
demKernelImages.m: Create plots of some covariance functions
demGPCov2D.m: Simple demonstration of sampling from a covariance function.
demGPSample.m: Simple demonstration of sampling from a covariance function.
demInterpolation.m: Demonstrate Gaussian processes for interpolation.
demManifoldPrint.m: Print the principal components of the artificial digits data set.
prepDemManifold.m: Read in handwritten 6 and prepare for visualisation.
demRegression.m: Demonstrate Gaussian processes for regression.
demGplvmTalk.m: Show demos for GP-LVM talk in order.
demOptimiseKern.m: Shows that there is an optimum for the kernel length scale.
